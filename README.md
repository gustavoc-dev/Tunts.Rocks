<h1>Welcome</h1>

Hi! Welcome to my selection process for Tunts.rock

I'm in the technical challenge part, where I have to create an application in a programming language of my choice, I chose to use Javascript. The application must be able to read a Google Sheets spreadsheet, search for the necessary information, calculate and write the result in the spreadsheet.

I used the xlsx.js library for this application.
<br>
<a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx'>xlsx.js</a>

I also created a copy of the spreadsheet used in the challenge, according to the instructions.

<a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13XjO37lhhZVJfvaRuYOc60YJWA8hnbiiJoI0MPaCeic/edit?usp=drive_link'>Google Drive link.</a>

<h1>Instructions</h1>

Firstly I started npm in the application
``` javascript
  npm init --y
```
Then I installed the xlsx.json library
``` javascript
  npm install xlsx
```

I used a VsCode extension to view spreadsheets in the IDE called Excel Viewer
<br>

The code is commented to make it easier to understand, the spreadsheet in the file folder will be edited, but there will be a folder with the spreadsheet without editing, I used node.js to run the index.js file
```javascript
  node index.js
```
<h1>Thanks!</h1>

I would like to thank you for the opportunity and I hope to have achieved the expected quality ðŸ¤˜
